# Passport JWT
I have implemented token based auth using passport-jwt strategy.

## Running the application

### Frontend setup
 Follow JWT-frontend repo.
 
  
  ### Backend setup
 1 . Logic is available in backend folder in PassportLocal-React forder.

 2 . `$ npm i` to install all the depencencies.

 3 . Setup your .env file (optional).

 ### Flow
 Frontend on X-port interacts with server on Y-port. You can register, login & log user out from React client.

### Note:
Need to have node installed
